    "This assessment touches the very first step of analyzing textual data, i.e., extracting data from unstructured text files. ​Each student is provided with a data-set that contains several job postings (please find your own file from ​task1.rar​, i.e., ​<your_student_number>.dat​). Each data-set contains information about the units, e.g., unit code, title, synopsis, pre_requisites, prohibitions,etc . Your task is to extract the data and transform the data to the ​XML ​and ​JSON ​format. ​Please note that the ​re ​and ​json packages ​in​ Python​ are the only packages that you are allowed to use in this task and the following must be performed to complete the assessment."

In fact, European unity has been propelled by war since 1945: not just at the founding moment at the end of the Second World War (NATO, EEC, WEU), but by anti-colonial nationalists pushing European powers towards pro-active European policies, and in EU responses to the conflicts in the former Yugoslavia (OSCE, CFSP), Iraq, Libya and the challenges posed by refugee movements and global terrorism.

The focus of this unit is on dominant modes of governance, with a particular emphasis on processes of democracy and democratisation. In exploration of this, the unit will explore the development of formal participatory democracy, particularly liberal democracy, as a global norm through the 20th century before examining the pressures for and against democratic development across the world. From a focus on various forms of established liberal democracy (presidential and parliamentary systems), this unit will move to detailed case studies of the Middle East, Latin America, and South-East Asia to investigate efforts at formalising political participation, the persistence of informal modes of participation, and the perseverance of autocratic and authoritarian rule.', '</synopsis>', '<pre_requistics>NA</pre_requistics>', '<prohibisions>', '<prohibisions>APG4337</prohibisions>', '<prohibisions>ATS4337</prohibisions>', '</prohibisions>', '<requirements>', '<requirement>Within semester assessment: 100%</requirement>', '</requirements>', '<outcomes>', '<outcome>An ability to critically engage in key debates framing global politics and international relationsAn ability to work in and adapt to a variety of different cultural and professional environmentsAn ability to display intricate knowledge of a variety of value and ethical systems, and conduct themselves professionally in all working environmentsAn ability to be innovators in their chosen fieldAn ability to apply the highest standard of analytical and critical skillsAn ability to design and manage large and focused research projectsAn ability to communicate succinctly, directly, and highly effectively</outcome>', '</outcomes>', '<chief_examiners>', '<chief_examiner>Associate Professor Benjamin MacQueen</chief_examiner>', '</chief_examiners>', '</unit>', '<unit id=\"ATS3938\">', '<title>', 'Leadership for social change 3 (overseas intensive).', '</title>', '<synopsis>', 'This unit builds on the foundations of Leadership for Social Change 1 and 2.

How palaeontology developed as a discipline is presented as an overview of the global impacts of the discipline on science and the major players from its earliest origins in Medieval Europe to much later 19th Century researchers in Australia with associated discoveries of megafauna, dinosaurs, early fish, metazoans, and other major finds, that persist with active research to the present day.  Significant milestones in the history of life covered include the early origin of life, metazoan origins in the late Precambrian, Cambrian 'explosion' of organisms with hard parts (both invertebrate and vertebrate), evolution and mass extinctions and their outcomes, biodiversity patterns through time, biologic effects from extraterrestrial impacts, biotic outcomes from volcanism, changing climate and geography (impact of developing aridity on biota, 'Snowball Earth' metazoan origins), the coevolution of plants and animals,  the influences of the plant biosphere with the global environment, and the origin of major animal groups (e.g., molluscs, echinoderms, fish, marsupials). Emphasis on strengths/weaknesses of interpretive methods and how complex science can be presented to a wide audience is also explored. Palaeontology has developed from a more descriptive science of documenting ancient organic remains and their affinities to become also a significant applied field in the quest for global economic resources, such as petroleum (oil and gas), coal and even gold (e.g., graptolite fossils used to date rocks in the Lachlan Fold Belt and associated goldfields of Victoria).  Furthermore, the fossil record has been shown to have remarkable explanatory power for global and regional environmental and ecological changes across a deep time perspective.  As such, lectures and practical's will integrate fossil and many other types of geologic data sets to reinforce how palaeontology endeavours have become 'big picture' science.
